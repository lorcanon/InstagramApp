Instagram app for Showoff test

Because of availability of iPhones and Mac this project was developed and tested with Xcode version 9.2 and iOS 10.2.1 on an iPhone 5c only.
See some comments in individual files.

The login screen is a webview - it looks like that's the only possibility made available by Instagram for logging in.
The second screen is a scrollable collectionview with 3 cells. The top cell has the profile data (just the profile photo 
and the name) and the bottom 2 cells have posted photos and the captions on them.
